# AFTAS Project Docker Integration

## Project Context
The goal of this phase is to finalize your AFTAS project by incorporating Docker to encapsulate your web applications, specifically your Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend, within a single container. This integration allows for seamless deployment and execution of the application by combining these two technologies.

## Tasks to Accomplish:

### Docker File Creation:

1. **Write Docker Files:**
   - Create Dockerfiles (and docker-compose.yml if necessary) for both the backend and frontend.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Configure dependencies and execution commands to build and run the applications within a single Docker container.

### Application Integration:

1. **Communication Setup:**
   - Ensure effective communication between the backend and frontend within the Docker environment.

2. **Service Consumption:**
   - Confirm that the frontend can consume services exposed by the backend within the container.

### Testing and Validation:

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Perform tests to ensure that the application functions correctly within the Docker container.

2. **Feature Validation:**
   - Validate that both backend and frontend functionalities are accessible and operational.

### Documentation and Presentation:

1. **Configuration and Execution Guide:**
   - Provide clear documentation outlining the steps for configuration and execution within Docker.

2. **Detailed Presentation:**
   - Prepare a detailed presentation explaining the adopted approach, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.

## Getting Started

To use Docker for your AFTAS project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AFTAS-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AFTAS-project`
3. Build and run the Docker container: `docker-compose up`
4. Access your application at [http://localhost:your-port](http://localhost:your-port)
